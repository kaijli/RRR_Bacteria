Water samples were collected and inoculated onto different culture media to isolate the highest number of species. 16S rDNA fragments from colonies growing on solid media were amplified and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Sequencing revealed the presence of 21 different bacteria belonging to several phylogenetic groups (α, β, and γ-Proteobacteria, Actinomycetales, Flavobacterium, and the Bacillus/Staphylococcus group). The isolation of these microorganisms in this particular environment (oligotrophic and radioactive) is highly interesting because of the possibility of their being used for the bioremediation of radionuclide-contaminated waters.},

A well-protected functional proteome ensures cell recovery from extensive radiation damage to other cellular constituents by molecular repair and turnover processes, including an efficient repair of disintegrated DNA. Therefore, cell death correlates with radiation-induced protein damage, rather than DNA damage, in both robust and standard species. From the reviewed biology of resistance to radiation and other sources of oxidative damage, we conclude that the impact of protein damage on the maintenance of life has been largely underestimated in biology and medicine., The proteome, rather than the genome, may be the prime target in radiation-induced cell death. Deinococcus radiodurans is a robust bacterium that can protect its proteins from oxidative damage, thereby preserving their activity.},

in patients with breast cancer, but some patients may be more susceptible to ionizing
radiation, and increased exposure to radiation sources may be associated to radiation
adverse events. This susceptibility may be related to deficiencies in DNA repair
mechanisms that are activated after cell-radiation, which causes DNA damage,
particularly DNA double strand breaks. Some of these genetic susceptibilities in
DNA-repair mechanisms are implicated in the etiology of hereditary breast/ovarian
cancer (pathologic mutations in the BRCA 1 and 2 genes), but other
less penetrant variants in genes involved in sporadic breast cancer have been
described. These same genetic susceptibilities may be involved in negative
radiotherapeutic outcomes. For these reasons, it is necessary to implement methods
for detecting patients who are susceptible to radiotherapy-related adverse events.
This review discusses mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, genes related to these
functions, and the diagnosis methods designed and under research for detection of
breast cancer patients with increased radiosensitivity.},

	abstract = {Networks of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators are critical for bacterial survival and adaptation to environmental stressors. While transcriptional regulators provide rapid activation and/or repression of a wide-network of genes, post-transcriptional regulators, such as small RNAs (sRNAs), are also important to fine-tune gene expression. However, the mechanisms of sRNAs remain poorly understood, especially in less-studied bacteria. Deinococcus radiodurans is a gram-positive bacterium resistant to extreme levels of ionizing radiation (IR). Although multiple unique regulatory systems (e.g., the Radiation and Desiccation Response (RDR)) have been identified in this organism, the role of post-transcriptional regulators has not been characterized within the IR response. In this study, we have characterized an sRNA, PprS (formerly Dsr2), as a post-transcriptional coordinator of IR recovery in D. radiodurans. PprS showed differential expression specifically under IR and knockdown of PprS resulted in reduced survival and growth under IR, suggesting its importance in regulating post-radiation recovery. We determined a number of potential RNA targets involved in several pathways including translation and DNA repair. Specifically, we confirmed that PprS binds within the coding region to stabilize the pprM (DR\_0907) transcript, a RDR modulator. Overall, these results are the first to present an additional layer of sRNA-based control in DNA repair pathways associated with bacterial radioresistance.},

Because of their inherent nature, diverse habitats and production processes, seafood products are highly prone to biohazards including pathogenic microorganism, viruses, and also parasites that can affect human health. Conventional processing technologies and hygienic practices are not fully compatible to eliminate these hazards. Exposure to ionizing radiation is a plausible cold process to enhance the safety of fishery products through inactivation of foodborne pathogens, without significantly affecting sensory properties of the food. Because of the penetration nature of radiation, the treatment can eliminate these organisms even from frozen, packaged, ready-to-ship fishery products. Whereas gamma radiations generated from radioisotopes of cobalt and cesium have been used for the purpose, the treatment has not met commercial success because of practical problems with respect to use of radioisotopes and poor consumer acceptance of food exposed to gamma rays. The treatment by electron beam is a commercially feasible method to ensure food safety. Electron beam irradiation has potential to reduce seafood-borne biohazards facilitating global seafood security.},

	abstract = {Microbial diversity is essential for the maintenance of the normal structure and function of bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). As a typical nutrient-deficient environment (NDE), the BLSS does not provide sufficient types of available substrates for microbial communities, and its internal microbial diversity is usually not high due to interspecific competitive exclusion. However, it is reported that microbial diversity is abnormally high in the International Space Station (ISS) after long-term exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR). It remains a mystery why LDIR leads to the formation and maintenance of high microbial diversity. In this study, a series of artificial microbial communities have been cultivated in NDE without and with LDIR, respectively. These communities are composed of three common microbial species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in the ISS. By comparing and analyzing the differences in the microbial physiological and behavioral response characteristics in the two scenarios, a reasonable hypothesis was put forward to elucidate the formation and maintenance mechanisms of high microbial diversity in NDE with LDIR. Then a set of kinetic models were developed based on this hypothesis, observed phenomena, and experimental data. Finally, these kinetic models were sufficiently validated and the hypothesis was fully confirmed through large-scale digital simulations. Briefly, two fundamental succession mechanisms of the microbial communities are supposed to exist in NDE with LDIR: substrate-based negative feedback regulation (SNFR) and microbial delayed responses. These two decisive succession mechanisms can give rise to asynchronously convergent fluctuations of microbial populations and significantly alleviate the interspecific competitions. Such a species-for-quantity strategy drives the microbial communities to form and maintain species diversity with higher richness and evenness. This study can lay the theoretical foundation and provide new ideas for the construction of advanced BLSS featured with more robust structures and stronger function.},

Another approach, pioneered by Evelyn Witkin in 1946, is to utilize experimental evolution. Contributions to the IR-resistance phenotype affect multiple aspects of cell physiology, including DNA repair, removal of reactive oxygen species, the structure and packaging of DNA and the cell itself, and repair of iron-sulfur centers.

	abstract = {Deinococcus radiodurans is among a small number of bacterial species that are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation, UV light, toxic chemicals, and desiccation. We measured proteome oxidation (i.e., protein carbonylation, PC) in D. radiodurans as well as in standard and evolved resistant strains of Escherichia coli exposed to ionizing radiation or UVC light and found a consistent correlation with cell killing. The unique quantitative relationship between incurred PC and cell death holds over the entire range of killing for all tested bacteria and for both lethal agents, meaning that both bacterial species are equally sensitive to PC. We show that the extraordinary robustness of D. radiodurans depends on efficient proteome protection (but not DNA protection) against constitutive and radiation-induced PC consisting of low molecular weight cytosolic compounds. Remarkably, experimental evolution of resistance to ionizing radiation in E. coli coevolves with protection against PC. The decline in biosynthetic efficacy of the cellular proteome, as measured by the loss of reproduction of undamaged bacteriophage λ in irradiated standard and evolved ionizing radiation-resistant E. coli, correlates with radiation-induced oxidative damage to host cells and their sensitivity to ionizing radiation. This correlation suggests that cell death by radiation is caused primarily by oxidative damage with consequential loss of maintenance activities including DNA repair.},

Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms.Methodology/Principal FindingsIonizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of 14C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants. In addition, radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions.Conclusions/SignificanceExposure of melanin to ionizing radiation, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic radiation, changes its electronic properties. Melanized fungal cells manifested increased growth relative to non-melanized cells after exposure to ionizing radiation, raising intriguing questions about a potential role for melanin in energy capture and utilization.},

Radiation causes severe DNA lesions, including double-strand breaks, and leads to genome instability and even lethality. Regardless of the toxicity of radiation, some organisms exhibit extraordinary tolerance against radiation. These organisms are supposed to possess special mechanisms to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damages. Extensive study using radiotolerant bacteria suggested that effective protection of proteins and enhanced DNA repair system play important roles in tolerability against high-dose radiation. Recent studies using an extremotolerant animal, the tardigrade, provides new evidence that a tardigrade-unique DNA-associating protein, termed Dsup, suppresses the occurrence of DNA breaks by radiation in human-cultured cells. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the current knowledge on extremely radiotolerant animals, and present novel insights from the tardigrade research, which expand our understanding on molecular mechanism of exceptional radio-tolerability.},

In our experiments, we eliminated the confounding effects of carbon as a fungal resource, by developing experimental protocols that expose fungal spores and their germinating hyphae to directional sources of ionizing radiation allowing us to measure fungal response to ionizing radiation per se. We show that both beta and gamma radiation promote directional growth of hyphae towards the source of ionizing radiation.},

	abstract = {There has been a signiﬁcant surge in consumption of radionuclides for various academic and commercial purposes. Correspondingly, there has been a considerable amount of generation of radioactive waste. Bacteria and archaea, being earliest inhabitants on earth serve as model microorganisms on earth. These microbes have consistently proven their mettle by surviving extreme environments, even extreme ionizing radiations. Their ability to accept and undergo stable genetic mutations have led to development of recombinant mutants that are been exploited for remediation of various pollutants such as; heavy metals, hydrocarbons and even radioactive waste (radwaste). Thus, microbes have repeatedly presented themselves to be prime candidates suitable for remediation of radwaste. It is interesting to study the behind-the-scenes interactions these microbes possess when observed in presence of radionuclides. The emphasis is on the indigenous bacteria isolated from radionuclide containing environments as well as the ﬁve fundamental interaction mechanisms that have been studied extensively, namely; bioaccumulation, biotransformation, biosorption, biosolubilisation and bioprecipitation. Application of microbes exhibiting such mechanisms in remediation of radioactive waste depends largely on the individual capability of the species. Challenges pertaining to its potential bioremediation activity is also been brieﬂy discussed. This review provides an insight into the various mechanisms bacteria uses to tolerate, survive and carry out processes that could potentially lead the eco-friendly approach for removal of radionuclides.},

	abstract = {The in situ stimulation of Fe(III) oxide reduction by Geobacter bacteria leads to the concomitant precipitation of hexavalent uranium [U(VI)] from groundwater. Despite its promise for the bioremediation of uranium contaminants, the biological mechanism behind this reaction remains elusive. Because Fe(III) oxide reduction requires the expression of Geobacter's conductive pili, we evaluated their contribution to uranium reduction in Geobacter sulfurreducens grown under pili-inducing or noninducing conditions. A pilin-deficient mutant and a genetically complemented strain with reduced outer membrane c-cytochrome content were used as controls. Pili expression significantly enhanced the rate and extent of uranium immobilization per cell and prevented periplasmic mineralization. As a result, pili expression also preserved the vital respiratory activities of the cell envelope and the cell's viability. Uranium preferentially precipitated along the pili and, to a lesser extent, on outer membrane redox-active foci. In contrast, the pilus-defective strains had different degrees of periplasmic mineralization matching well with their outer membrane c-cytochrome content. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrated the extracellular reduction of U(VI) by the pili to mononuclear tetravalent uranium U(IV) complexed by carbon-containing ligands, consistent with a biological reduction. In contrast, the U(IV) in the pilin-deficient mutant cells also required an additional phosphorous ligand, in agreement with the predominantly periplasmic mineralization of uranium observed in this strain. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Geobacter conductive pili in the extracellular reduction of uranium, and highlight its essential function as a catalytic and protective cellular mechanism that is of interest for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater.},

In recent years, several international studies have been carried out, which have reported different values regarding the effect of background radiation on human health. Gamma radiation emitted from natural sources (background radiation) is largely due to primordial radionuclides, mainly 232Th and 238U series, and their decay products, as well as 40K, which exist at trace levels in the earth's crust. Their concentrations in soil, sands, and rocks depend on the local geology of each region in the world. Naturally occurring radioactive materials generally contain terrestrial-origin radionuclides, left over since the creation of the earth. In addition, the existence of some springs and quarries increases the dose rate of background radiation in some regions that are known as high level background radiation regions. The type of building materials used in houses can also affect the dose rate of background radiations. The present review article was carried out to consider all of the natural radiations, including cosmic, terrestrial, and food radiation.},

	abstract = {In connection with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) accident and the negative ecological after-effects for biota in this zone the interest has arisen to radioresistant bacteria, as to the most dynamic model of the given ecosystem, and to mechanisms which provide resistance of bacteria to ionizing radiation. The analysis of published data has shown that the radioresistant bacteria are not interrelated taxonomically and phylogenetically. The extreme radioresistant bacteria are represented by the Deinococcus species, which form a group phylogenetically close to the line Thermus-Meiothermus. Other radioresistant bacteria are the representatives of the genera Rubrobacter, Methylobacterium, Kocuria, Bacillus and some archebacteria. Data on natural habitats, of radioresistant bacteria are not numerous. In a number of cases it is difficult to distinguish their natural habitats, as they were isolated from the samples which were previously exposed to X-ray or gamma-irradiation, or from the ecosystems with the naturally raised radioactivity. To understand the strategy of survival of radioresistant bacteria, we briefly reviewed the mechanism of action of various species of radiation on cells and macromolecules; physiological signs of the cell damage caused by radiation; mechanisms eliminating (repairing) these damages. More details on mechanisms of the DNA repair in D. radiodurans are described. The extreme resistance of D. radiodurans to the DNA damaging factors is defined by 1) repair mechanisms which fundamentally differ from those in other procaryotes; 2) ability to increase the efficiency of a standard set of the DNA repairing proteins. Literary and own data on the effect of radiation on survival of various groups of bacteria in natural ecosystems are summarized. The ecological consequences of the ChNPP accident for soil bacteria in this region were estimated. The reduction of the number of soil bacteria and recession of microbial diversity under the effect of anthropogenic radiation was shown.},

	abstract = {The thyroid uptake and scan is a radiologic diagnostic tool used to determine the thyroid function and pathologies. This diagnostic procedure works on the principle of the unstable nuclide of the atom, which tries to attain stability by releasing an alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Clinicians use these rays for diagnostic and treatment purposes. The test uses a radioactive tracer, which is a protein or a molecule attached to radioactive material. The radioactive tracer is administered into the patient, and a probe measures the amount of iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The thyroid scan checks for the even spread of the tracer in the gland. More than 20 radioactive tracers exist, of which two isotopes of iodine I-123 and I-131 and 99m-technetium pertechnetate, are the usual agents used in this test. I-131 has a longer half-life than I-123, so I-123 is used more frequently than I-131 due to less radiation exposure to the body. 99m-Technetium pertechnetate is an analog of iodine, so it gets transported to the thyroid gland similarly to iodine. 111In-pentoxide, thallium-201 (201T1), 99mTc-sestamibi, 99mTc-tetrofosmin are some of the less commonly used radioactive tracers in this test.[1] This test is different than radioactive iodine therapy, which treats thyroid cancers.},

Previous studies at the Rifle IFRC have linked microbial processes to uranium immobilization during acetate amendment. Several key bacteria believed to be involved in radionuclide containment have been described; however, most of the evidence implicating uranium reduction with specific microbiota has been indirect. Here, we report on the cultivation of a microorganism from the Rifle IFRC that reduces uranium and appears to utilize it as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration with acetate as electron donor. Furthermore, this bacterium constitutes a significant proportion of the subsurface sediment community prior to biostimulation based on TRFLP profiling of 16S rRNA genes. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicates that the microorganism is a betaproteobacterium with a high similarity to Burkholderia fungorum. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a betaproteobacterium capable of uranium respiration. Our results indicate that this microorganism occurs commonly in alluvial sediments located between 3-6 m below ground surface at Rifle and may play a role in the initial reduction of uranium at the site.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is one of the most common countermeasures for treating a wide range of tumors. However, the radioresistance of cancer cells is still a major limitation for radiotherapy applications. Efforts are continuously ongoing to explore sensitizing targets and develop radiosensitizers for improving the outcomes of radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks are the most lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation and can trigger a series of cellular DNA damage responses (DDRs), including those helping cells recover from radiation injuries, such as the activation of DNA damage sensing and early transduction pathways, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. Obviously, these protective DDRs confer tumor radioresistance. Targeting DDR signaling pathways has become an attractive strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance, and some important advances and breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years. On the basis of comprehensively reviewing the DDR signal pathways, we provide an update on the novel and promising druggable targets emerging from DDR pathways that can be exploited for radiosensitization. We further discuss recent advances identified from preclinical studies, current clinical trials, and clinical application of chemical inhibitors targeting key DDR proteins, including DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), ATM/ATR (ataxia–telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related), the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, the PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) family, MDC1, Wee1, LIG4 (ligase IV), CDK1, BRCA1 (BRCA1 C terminal), CHK1, and HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1). Challenges for ionizing radiation-induced signal transduction and targeted therapy are also discussed based on recent achievements in the biological field of radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Radiation therapy is an effective cancer therapy, but damage to normal tissues surrounding the tumor due to radiotherapy causes severe complications. The importance of the therapeutic area between tumor suppression and normal tissue injury has long been highlighted in radiation therapy. Recent advances in stem cell biology have shown that stem cell (SC) responses to genotoxic stresses of ionizing radiation can improve the therapeutic effect of radiation by repairing damaged cells. In contrast, cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of cells within tumors, are generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and cause tumor recurrence. Although the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood in detail, efforts are still underway to identify SC treatment or CSC resistant pathogenesis of DNA damage agents such as radiation therapy. In response to radiation, CSCs differ from normal SCs in their biological properties due to severe deregulation of the self-renewal ability in CSCs. Differences of cleavage mode, cell cycle characteristics, replication potential, and activation/inactivation of DNA damage treatment and cancer-specific molecular pathways between normal SCs and CSCs confer a malignant phenotype upon CSCs. However, further studies are needed to identify normal SC and CSC-specific targets. In this review, we summarize the current advances in research regarding how normal SCs and CSCs respond to ionizing radiation, with a special emphasis on cell toxicity, radiosensitivity, signaling networks, DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. In addition, we discuss strategies to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for predicting responses to cancer treatment and overcoming radiation-related toxicity.},

	abstract = {The current age of dynamic development of the space industry brings the mankind closer to routine manned space flights and space tourism. This progress leads to a demand for intensive astrobiological research aimed at improving strategies of the pharmacological protection of the human cells against extreme conditions. Although routine research in space remains out of our reach, it is worth noticing that the unique severe environment of the Earth’s stratosphere has been found to mimic subcosmic conditions, giving rise to the opportunity to use the stratospheric surface as a research model for the astrobiological studies. Our study included launching into the stratosphere a balloon containing mammalian normal and cancer cells treated with various compounds to examine whether these substances are capable of protecting the cells against stress caused by rapidly varying temperature, pressure, and radiation, especially UV. Owing to oxidative stress caused by irradiation and temperature shock, we used natural compounds which display antioxidant properties, namely, catechin isolated from green tea, honokiol derived from magnolia, curcumin from turmeric, and cinnamon extract. “After-flight” laboratory tests have shown the most active antioxidants as potential agents which can minimize harmful impact of extreme conditions on human cells.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is widely applied for multiple malignant tumors ablation in the clinic. However, redundant doses of X-rays might destroy normal tissue in the periphery of tumor sites. Here, we developed an integrated nanosystem (Bac@BNP) composed of engineered bacteria (Bac) and Bi2S3 nanoparticles (BNPs) for sensitizing radiotherapy. Bac could target and colonize in tumor sites alternatively, which overexpressed cytolysin A (ClyA) protein to regulate the cell cycle from a radioresistant phase to a radiosensitive phase. Simultaneously, peptide-modified BNPs, as a radiosensitizer with a high-Z element, was released from the surface of Bac owing to the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) response in the tumor microenvironment. Under X-ray irradiation, BNPs could enhance the radiotherapy sensitivity by triggering the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), coupled with DNA damage. In this constructed nanosystem, the combination of Bac@BNP and X-ray irradiation led to significant suppression of breast carcinoma in murine models with reduced side effects.},

	abstract = {The Taklimakan Desert located in China is the second-largest shifting sand desert in the world and is known for its harsh conditions. Types of γ-rays or UV radiation-resistant bacterial strains have been isolated from this desert. However, there is no information regarding the proportions of the radiation-resistant strains in the total culturable microbes. We isolated 352 bacterial strains from nine sites across the Taklimakan Desert from north to south. They belong to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The phylum Actinobacteria was the most predominant in abundance and Firmicutes had the highest species richness. Bacteroidetes had the lowest abundance and was found in four sites only, while the other three phyla were found in every site but with different distribution profiles. After irradiating with 1000 J/m2 and 6000 J/m2 UV-C, the strains with survival rates higher than 10\% occupied 72.3\% and 36.9\% of all culturable bacteria, respectively. The members from Proteobacteria had the highest proportions, with survival rates higher than 10\%. After radiation with 10 kGy γ-rays, Kocuria sp. TKL1057 and Planococcus sp. TKL1152 showed higher radiation-resistant capabilities than Deinococcus radiodurans R1. Besides obtaining several radiation-resistant extremophiles, this study measured the proportions of the radiation-resistant strains in the total culturable microbes for the first time. This study may help to better understand the origin of radioresistance, especially by quantitatively comparing proportions of radiation-resistant extremophiles from different environments in the future.},

Because of the danger and expense of cleaning up of such radioactive sites by physicochemical processes, in situ bioremediation methods are being developed for cleanup of contaminated ground and groundwater. Microbial treatment of these high-level radioactive sites is employed by bacteria and fungi. Fungi including Alternaria alternata, Fusarium verticillioides, and Aspergillus pulverulents are tested for its ability to uptake radio-cobalt (Co-60) and radio-cesium (Cs-137) from radionuclide-containing medium. The conditions of radioisotope uptake are optimized such as the form of the fungal organism either spores or mycelium, inoculum age, and pH of growing medium. Furthermore, the total pigments of the tested fungi are extracted and tested for their ability to bind with radioisotope. This chapter describes a protocol for assessing the mycoremediation technology of acidic radioactive wastes.},

	abstract = {The Actinomycetales order is one of great genetic and functional diversity, including diversity in the production of secondary metabolites which have uses in medical, environmental rehabilitation, and industrial applications. Secondary metabolites produced by actinomycete species are an abundant source of antibiotics, antitumor agents, anthelmintics, and antifungals. These actinomycete-derived medicines are in circulation as current treatments, but actinomycetes are also being explored as potential sources of new compounds to combat multidrug resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Actinomycetes as a potential to solve environmental concerns is another area of recent investigation, particularly their utility in the bioremediation of pesticides, toxic metals, radioactive wastes, and biofouling. Other applications include biofuels, detergents, and food preservatives/additives. Exploring other unique properties of actinomycetes will allow for a deeper understanding of this interesting taxonomic group. Combined with genetic engineering, microbial experimental evolution, and other enhancement techniques, it is reasonable to assume that the use of marine actinomycetes will continue to increase. Novel products will begin to be developed for diverse applied research purposes, including zymology and enology. This paper outlines the current knowledge of actinomycete usage in applied research, focusing on marine isolates and providing direction for future research.},

	abstract = {The practice of phage therapy, which uses bacterial viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections, has been around for almost a century. The universal decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics has generated renewed interest in revisiting this practice. Conventionally, phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring phages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection. Biotechnological advances have further expanded the repertoire of potential phage therapeutics to include novel strategies using bioengineered phages and purified phage lytic proteins. Current research on the use of phages and their lytic proteins, specifically against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, suggests phage therapy has the potential to be used as either an alternative or a supplement to antibiotic treatments. Antibacterial therapies, whether phage- or antibiotic-based, each have relative advantages and disadvantages; accordingly, many considerations must be taken into account when designing novel therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating bacterial infections. Although much is still unknown about the interactions between phage, bacteria, and human host, the time to take phage therapy seriously seems to be rapidly approaching.},
